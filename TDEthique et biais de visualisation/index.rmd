## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr) 
library(readr)
lebron <- tibble(year = c(2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016), points = c(20.9, 27.2, 31.4, 27.3, 30, 28.4, 29.7, 26.8, 27.1, 26.8, 27.1, 25.3, 25.3, 26.4))





ggplot(lebron, aes(x=year,y=points)) + 
    geom_line()+ geom_point() +  ylim(0, max(lebron$points)*5)


lebron = lebron %>% mutate(diff = if_else(points>min(lebron$points),"haut","sous")) 
ggplot(lebron, aes(x=year,y=points,fill=diff)) + 
    geom_col()+ylim(0, max(lebron$points)*5)


```
